## A Little About How To start or where you can find your own

Actually, I started From C Lang But I don't think you should start From lang-C in 2022 or after this year. It's not that you should start with as I did but One thing you can focus on here.
1. you should learn a Programming lang First of all. 
2. Once you learned a Lang it will be very easy to understand the other one. So I started with C-lang but yu should start with Java or Python whatever you found worth it for you.
